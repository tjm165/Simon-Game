# Simon-Game
Here are some implementations of the "Simon Says" games that I made in high school.
This demonstrates my programming knowledge before taking any formal classes. Everything I wrote was the product of teaching myself

There are 2 implementations to this game.
1. In the regular Simon game, the goal is to copy the sequence exactly as the computer displays it.
2. In the inverse Simon game, the goal is the opposite of the regular simon game.
   Instead of copying the sequence, the goal is to do the exact opposite of what the computer does.
