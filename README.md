# Simon-Game
This is a couple of "Simon Says" type games that I made for fun during my senior year.
Note that I did not take a formal programming course while creating this. Therefore, I used poor object oriented coding.

There are 2 implementations to this game.
1. In the regular Simon game, the goal is to copy the sequence exactly as the computer displays it.
2. In the inverse Simon game, the goal is the opposite of the regular simon game.
   Instead of copying the sequence, the goal is to do the exact opposite of what the computer does.
